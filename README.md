# Movie Night Planner

## Introducing the Movie Night Planner

Movie Night Planner is a collaborative web application that simplifies group decision-making for movie selection.
Coordinating movie tastes among friends can be challenging, so our solution enables users to create personal profiles,
create and manage their Watch List (which is the list of movies a user wants so watch) and form groups. In those groups,
members can contribute to the group's pool of movies by adding up to two movies from their respective Watch List to it.  
Upon entering the voting phase, the movie pooling phase is closed automatically (thus no more movies can be added to the
group's movie pool). In the voting phase group members have the option to rank the movies in the group's movie pool.
Finally, the Movie Night Planner will announce the winning movie, which is the movie which represent the group members
preferences the best.<br />
Users can add films the Watch List via Search Movies. Upon accessing this page, the Movie Night Planner will provide the
user with personalized movie suggestions. Here the Movie Night Planner makes use of the user's genre, actor and director
favorites, which can be changed under the users profile. Movies can also be search for via title. The advances search
allows users to specify year, genres, actors and directors.<br />
The necessary data on movies, actors and directors is provided by the external TMDb API: https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started

## Launch & Deployment

Please refer to the following files for a description on how to get started with this application, including
which commands are required to build and run this project locally and how to run tests.

-   [Launch_and_Deployment_Client.md](https://github.com/minnaheim/group_19_client/blob/main/Launch_and_Deployment_Client.md)
-   [Launch_and_Deployment_Server](https://github.com/minnaheim/group_19_server/blob/main/Launch_and_Deployment_Server.md)

### Database:

We built the data base to work in two ways:

-   If run locally, the Database was in memory, so that it only lasts for the length that the database runs
-   Once deployed, an external PostgreSQL database was used through [Supabase](https://supabase.com) which offers free databases for small projects.

### TMDb API: We requested an API key under the following link:<br />

https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api<br />
We've stored it in the server's Github Secrets, refer to
[TMDbConfig.java](https://github.com/minnaheim/group_19_server/blob/main/src/main/java/ch/uzh/ifi/hase/soprafs25/config/TMDbConfig.java)

## Roadmap

We suggest adding these features to this project:

-   Adding an additional list (besides the existing lists: Watch List and Already Seen) so that users can dismiss movies suggested. The endpoint GET /movies/suggestions/{userId} needs to be updated, so that these movies in this "dismissed/ do not like list" are filtered out and so that other movies are suggested.
-   Add YouTube functionality to the project: Applying for a youtube API Key, and displaying trailer directly in the Movie Night Planner instead of redirecting to youtube. https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3?hl=en
-   Providing the same functionalities for TV Series's as well
